# Modified Unified Daughterboard S 


## Changes 

- switched to the reliable JST connector.
- replaced esd chip to the PRTR5V.
- changed the fotprint to 0805 and SOD123.
- switched to a 2 layer pcb.


## Why Change?

i made a custom keyboard design a while ago with the UDS-S and i hand soldered all the components myself because im broke. 
there were a few problems i encountered with the doughterboard:
- the board was extremely difficult to solder. expecially the tiny esd chip.
- the ezmate molex connector is trash. after soldering up the board the connector kept snapping off the board.
i dont know why the connector kept snapping off but the fact that it pulls up to dissconnect only encourages its snapping off.
- i switched to 2 layer just because i didnt use more than the 2 layers when routing.


honestly i dont know if ill make this design but well see...
